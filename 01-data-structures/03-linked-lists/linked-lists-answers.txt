1)What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
    Spatial Locality is how close pieces of data are to one another in physical memory.  This is a huge performance benefit because if related bits of data are next to one another they are very easy to find since the processor will not have to look far to find it.

2)Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
    
    -Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.
	In the Array my user, system, and total time was 0 while the elapsed time was ~0.002500.  For the Linked List was similar with an elapsed time of ~0.006400.  Already we can see the advantage of spatial locality for the array.
    
    -Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
	In the Array my user, system, and total time was 0 while the elapsed time was ~0.002700.  Just slightly more time that to create the Array.  For the linked list the user time finally ticked in at 0.01, and the elapsed time ~0.007100.  Not a whole lot longer than creating the list, but clearly it took more processing power and time, something that will add up significantly as the list grows.
    
    -Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
	I got very similar results as the last test.
