Screen:
1) How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
-It allows the user to place a pixel with any valid Red, Blue, Green combination on a screen matrix that is set up like a grid.

2) If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
-We could run the `screen.at(x, y)` method and would receive the pixel data that is at those coordinates if the x and y values are within the range of our screen size.

3)What other real-world data can each structure represent?
-This type of data structure could be slightly modified and used for almost any 2d mapping purposes like a game board, or a floor plan.
